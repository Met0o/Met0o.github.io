At Prime Print, we take pride in every project we complete. Below are some of the exceptional works we've done for our clients over the years.

## Branding & Design Projects

### Local Cafe Rebranding

In 2020, we worked with "Cafe Sofia" to revamp their brand identity. This included a new logo, menu design, and storefront signage. The modern, yet timeless design reflects the cafe's commitment to fresh, local ingredients.

### Festival Poster Design

Crafted for the annual Sofia Music Fest, this vibrant and energetic poster captures the spirit of music and community. It was printed in large formats and distributed across the city.
